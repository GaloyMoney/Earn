      "text": "The Bretton Woods system was a monetary system established after World War II in order to address global economic instability and high levels of debt.\n\nUnder this system, many countries pegged their own currencies to the value of the US dollar, which was itself pegged to the value of gold at a fixed exchange rate. This meant that the value of other countries' currencies was indirectly tied to the value of gold through the US dollar.\n\nIn 1971, United States President Richard Nixon directed the US Treasury to stop allowing foreign governments to exchange their dollars for gold, a process known as \"convertibility.\"\n\nThe sudden end of convertibility of dollars for gold shocked the world and became known as the Nixon Shock, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system fixed exchange rates. It marked the beginning of a new monetary system based on floating exchange rates.\n",

      "text": "\"Fiat\" is a word that comes from Latin and means \"let it be done.\" When it is used to talk about money, it means that a government is creating a currency by decree alone.\n\nSince the Nixon Shock, fiat money is not backed by gold or silver and neither can it be directly converted for a fixed amount of gold, as it used to be before.\n\nThis means that their value comes from the fact that the government says they are valuable and that people trust that they will be able to use them to buy things.\n\nIn addition, governments often make it a law (legal tender) that merchants have to accept this type of fiat currency and that it is the only type of currency that can be used to pay taxes.\n",

Standardized payment protocols, which are established ways of making payments online, also played a role in the emergence of digital fiat.\n\nDigital fiat is increasingly replacing physical fiat due to its lower costs, faster speeds, and increased capabilities for surveillance. In other words, it is cheaper and faster to use digital fiat and it is easier to track transactions made with digital fiat.\n",

Many people have tried to create digital money that is not controlled by a government, but they have all had their own unique challenges.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto took all of these lessons into account and was the first to solve the double spending problem with the implementation of Bitcoin by creating a decentralized system that rewards honesty and makes it very costly to be dishonest.\n",
