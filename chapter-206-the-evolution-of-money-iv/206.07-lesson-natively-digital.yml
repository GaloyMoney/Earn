  Digital fiat money is a digital version of a product that was designed for the industrial age. It has all of the same problems and limitations as the original product. It is a closed system that is heavily controlled and designed to lose value over time.
  
  Bitcoin is a type of digital money that was specifically designed for the digital age. It can be improved and updated, and anyone can see and change the code that it is based on. It benefits from the ideas and creativity of anyone who works on it.

- answer: Digital fiat money is designed to increase in value over time, while Bitcoin is designed to lose value
