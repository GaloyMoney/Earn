      "Good job. Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism where transactions are batched into blocks and chained together to a blockchain. This way, every user knows that every coin is only spent once",
      "Not quite. The double coincidence of wants is a problem of barter that can be solved with money. Try again",
      "Hah no. The halving in bitcoin is not a problem, but part of the solution that Satoshi designed! More on that in Chapter 302. Try again!"

    "question": "Which problem did Satoshi have to solve to create Bitcoin",
    "text": "Satoshi's solution to the double spending problem was a breakthrough in computer science and distributed systems. Until Bitcoin, many believed that it would be unsolvable.\n\nHis solution allowed Satoshi to develop a new electronic cash system that for the first time made it possible for people to send digital money directly to each other, without needing a bank or other organization to help.\n",
