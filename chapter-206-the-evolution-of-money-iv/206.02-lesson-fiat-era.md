**Text:** &quot;Fiat&quot; is a word that comes from Latin and means &quot;let it be done.&quot; When it is used to talk about money, it means that a government is creating a currency by decree alone.

Since the Nixon Shock, fiat money is not backed by gold or silver and neither can it be directly converted for a fixed amount of gold, as it used to be before.

This means that their value comes from the fact that the government says they are valuable and that people trust that they will be able to use them to buy things.

In addition, governments often make it a law (legal tender) that merchants have to accept this type of fiat currency and that it is the only type of currency that can be used to pay taxes.
