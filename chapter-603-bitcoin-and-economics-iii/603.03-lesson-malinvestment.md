# 603.3 Lesson - malinvestment

**Screen:** malinvestment

**Headline:** Malinvestment

**Reward:** 3

**Text:** Malinvestment is when the prices of things are not accurate, which leads to money being put into things that are not very productive. This happens because it is hard to predict the future and make good choices about what to do with money.

When the market is not working correctly, it is like trying to use a compass when you are not sure where you are. An example of this is when companies can&#x27;t pay back their loans and have to borrow more money just to stay alive. This is like being a &quot;zombie&quot; company.

When the government is in charge of these decisions, they might make mistakes because they don&#x27;t have a good way to tell what is a good investment and what is not. This can lead to things like building a subway without enough trains or building a dam without enough power lines.
