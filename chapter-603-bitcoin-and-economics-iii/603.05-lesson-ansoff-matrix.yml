  The Ansoff Matrix is a tool that helps companies think about how they can grow and make more money. It helps them figure out what to do with a product or service they have, and how to sell it to different groups of people.
  
  In the case of bitcoin, it is a product that is like a type of digital money. It has the potential to be used by a lot of people in a lot of different ways. The people who work on bitcoin, like the people who write the code and help others understand how to use it, are trying to increase the number of people who use it and make it easier for them to do so.
  
  Bitcoin can be used to save money and protect it from being taken away, or it can be used to send and receive small amounts of money quickly, without having to go through a lot of steps. As more people start using bitcoin, it has the potential to grow and become more popular.
  
  It is also possible for people and companies to use bitcoin as part of their financial plans, to help protect their money from losing value. While the main reason people might use bitcoin now is to protect their wealth, the payment use case has been growing fast since the inception of the Lightning Network and other use cases may emerge.
