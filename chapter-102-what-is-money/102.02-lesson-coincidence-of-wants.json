    "question": "Which coincidence does money solve?",
    "text": "Centuries ago, before people had money, they would barter -- or haggle over how to trade one unique item, in exchange for another item or service. Let‚Äôs say you wanted to have a meal at the local restaurant, and offered the owner a broom. The owner might say ‚Äúno‚Äù -- but I will accept three hats instead, if you happen to have them. You can imagine how difficult and inefficient a ‚Äúbarter economy‚Äù would be! By contrast, with money, you can simply present a $20 bill. And you know that the restaurant owner will readily accept it.\n",
