  Thousands of years ago, a society in Micronesia used very large and scarce stones as a form of agreed currency. Starting in the 1500â€™s, rare Cowrie shells (found in the ocean) became commonly used in many nations as a form of money. And for millennia, gold has been used as a form of money for countries around the world -- including the United States (until 1971).
