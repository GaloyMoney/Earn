**Headline:** Public Key Cryptography

**Reward:** 2

**Text:** Another cornerstone of Bitcoin is Public Key Cryptography that uses a pair of keys - a public key and a private key - to sign transactions and verify the ownership of Bitcoin addresses.

The private key is a long string of characters that is used to authorize Bitcoin transactions. It is often represented as a combination of 12 words (sometimes 24). Only in the correct order do the words result in the corresponding private key.

Whoever knows the private key of a bitcoin address can control the bitcoin in that address. Therefore it is important that it is kept secret and never shared with anyone. Ideally, it should be stored offline, so that no unwanted program can access it.
