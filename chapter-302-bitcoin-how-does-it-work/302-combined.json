Once the transaction is signed, it is broadcasted to the peer-to-peer network.\n\nMining is the process of adding transactions to the bitcoin blockchain. When a transaction is broadcasted to the network, it is picked up by miners, who verify that the transaction is valid (i.e., the user has the necessary funds and the private key used to sign the transaction corresponds to the public key associated with the funds).\n\nOnce a transaction has been verified, it is added to a block of transactions, along with a mathematical puzzle. Miners compete to solve the puzzle, and the first one to solve it gets to add the block to the blockchain and claim a reward in bitcoin. The reward is currently 6.25 bitcoins, plus any transaction fees that were included in the block.\n\nIn addition to adding transactions to the blockchain, mining also serves to secure the bitcoin network. This is because solving the puzzle requires a significant amount of computational power, and adding a block to the blockchain requires other miners to verify the solution. This makes it very difficult for any one person or group to manipulate the blockchain.\n",

Proof of work is what allows this to happen. The point of proof of work is to create an irrefutable history. If two histories compete, the one with the most work embedded in it wins.\n\nThe chain with the most work is the truth, by definition. This is called Nakamoto consensus. This works because work requires energy. In Bitcoin, work is computation. Not any kind of computation, but computation that has no shortcut: guessing.\n\n  In the absence of a central authority, proof of work is necessary because it ensures that there is no shortcut to adding transactions to the blockchain.\n\n  Miners must compete to solve the puzzle through brute force computation, which is probabilistic in nature, and the proof that the work has been done becomes self-evident in the outcome of the work. This makes it very difficult for any one person or group to manipulate the transaction history.\n",

This algorithm ensures that new blocks are found every 10 minutes on average.\n\nWhen more miners join the network, the average time required to find a new block goes down. In the opposite case, when miners leave the network, it takes longer to add a new block. The Difficulty Adjustment algorithm adjusts the difficulty of the mathematical puzzle to match changes in the combined computing power of all miners. This prevents the creation of more (or less) bitcoin units than the predetermined supply schedule.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to physical mining of precious metals like gold where adding more gold miners leads to a higher supply of gold and therefore a decrease in its price. In Bitcoin however, the addition of new miners only adds more security to the network.\n",
