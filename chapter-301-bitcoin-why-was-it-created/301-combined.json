        "text": "So what was the motivation to create Bitcoin? In his announcement of the project, Satoshi Nakamoto gave the following explanation:\n\n\"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust thatâ€™s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.\"\n",

This includes trust in the ability to pay off debts in the future, trust in commercial and central banks not to debase the currency, and trust in their ability to allow access to and freedom to use funds for transactions.\n\nThis trust has been violated numerous times, including during the 2008/09 Global Financial Crisis. In order to address this issue, Satoshi Nakamoto aimed to create a digital form of money that did not require trusting third parties for transactions and could not be debased by a central authority issuing more units.\n",

        "text": "Bitcoin is the result of decades of research work by a group of individuals who call themselves Cypherpunks. They are interested in using cryptography to promote privacy and security in a world where increasing surveillance in the digital age can lead to erosion of freedoms.\n\nEarlier digital cash systems that relied on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks had one or both of the following problems:\n\n  * They required a central authority to manage the ledger of ownership.\n  * The currency units could be copied, resulting in the \"double-spending problem\" where a single unit could be spent multiple times.\n\n  Satoshi addressed both of these issues by combining existing technologies in the creation of Bitcoin. The first issue is resolved because the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network means that there is no central authority that users need to trust. The second issue is addressed because the unique cryptographic techniques used in Bitcoin make it impossible to copy the currency units.\n",
