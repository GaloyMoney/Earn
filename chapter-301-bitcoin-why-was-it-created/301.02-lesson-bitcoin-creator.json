    "Correct! It's an interesting mystery, but it's worth noting that the bitcoin protocol is based on open source code, meaning that anyone can review it. This transparency makes it the most reviewed code in existence. Despite the mystery of its creator, bitcoin itself is an open and transparent monetary network that can be examined and used by anyone",
    "I'm sorry, but it looks like Craig Wright's claim to being the creator of bitcoin has been thoroughly debunked. Better luck with the next answer",
    "Nope! Elon Musk's talents might be better suited to launching rockets and building electric cars rather than creating revolutionary digital currencies. Try again!"
