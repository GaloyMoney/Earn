    "question": "What is one of the main consequences of excessive money printing and credit expansion",
    "text": "Excessive money printing and credit expansion can cause numerous social and economic issues, including asset bubbles in stocks and real estate markets which tend to experience corrections roughly every decade.\n\nWhile those closest to the source of new money often benefit greatly from these cycles, lower income individuals who don't own valuable assets and rely on regular paychecks are often the most affected by inflation and economic booms and busts created by the fiat currency system.\n\nA well-known example of this is the Global Financial Crisis that began in 2008, which was preceded by a significant accumulation of debt and risk in the commercial banking sector.\n",
