      "Congratulations, you are correct! A Nash Equilibrium is a concept in game theory that refers to a situation in which no player can gain an advantage by changing their strategy. In the context of choosing a store of value, achieving a Nash Equilibrium means that society has converged on a single store of value, which greatly facilitates trade and the division of labor. Fun fact: Bitcoin is often cited as an example of a Nash Equilibrium, as it has become the dominant cryptocurrency due to its perceived value and widespread adoption",
      "Sorry, that is not the correct answer. While a Nash Equilibrium has nothing to do with dance, it is an important concept in game theory that can benefit society",
      "I'm afraid that is not the correct answer. While music can bring people together and facilitate cooperation, a Nash Equilibrium has nothing to do with musical instruments.

    "question": "What is a Nash Equilibrium and how does it benefit society",
    "text": "Acquiring an item with the expectation that it will be desired as a future store of value can accelerate its adoption for that purpose. This process can create a feedback loop that drives societies towards adopting a single store of value.\n\nIn game theory, this is known as a \"Nash Equilibrium\". Reaching a Nash Equilibrium for a store of value can greatly benefit a society, as it makes trade and the division of labor easier and paves the way for the development of civilization.\n",
