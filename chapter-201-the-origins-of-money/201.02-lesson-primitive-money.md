**Reward:** 2

**Text:** Collectibles served as a precursor to money by allowing trade between different groups and facilitating the transfer of wealth between generations. Although they were not used as frequently as modern money in paleolithic societies, collectibles still served as a store of value and could sometimes even facilitate trade.

Primitive forms of money, such as collectibles, had a low velocity compared to modern currency and might only be transferred a few times during an individual&#x27;s lifetime. However, durable collectibles that were passed down through generations had substantial value at each transfer and sometimes made trade possible.
