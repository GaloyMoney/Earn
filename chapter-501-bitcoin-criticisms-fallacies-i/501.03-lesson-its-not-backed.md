# 501.3 Lesson - itsnotBacked

**Screen:** itsnotBacked

**Headline:** Should money be backed by something?

**Reward:** 3

**Text:** The idea of backed money is contradictory, as the backing itself would then be considered money. Part of the value of money comes from its rarity. Bitcoin does not need to be backed by something else that is rare because it is inherently scarce.

Verifiable and auditable through independent means, bitcoin is free of counterparty risk. There is no third party that must be trusted to keep and secure commodities or assets. If anything, it is possible that the future will be backed by bitcoin.

As Parker Lewis stated, "Ultimately, bitcoin is backed by something, and it's the only thing that backs any money: the credibility of its monetary properties."
