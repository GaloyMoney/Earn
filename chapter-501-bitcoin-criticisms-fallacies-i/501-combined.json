        "question": "How has the exchange rate of bitcoin trended over time",
        "text": "Over the years, bitcoin has often been called a bubble by various people. While its price has had several significant declines that may have warranted this label, the overall trend for bitcoin has been consistently upward.\n\nCritics who have proclaimed the death of bitcoin after each market cycle have been proven wrong, as the nascent digital money has continued to thrive despite their predictions. As these critics run out of analogies to use, it has become clear that their accusations are unfounded.\n",

        "text": "It is subjective to expect bitcoin to maintain a specific price range, as it is traded around the clock, every day of the year, across the world. There are no requirements for registration, bank holidays, circuit breakers, or bailouts in the bitcoin market, which operates as a truly free market.\n\nAny and all volatility in bitcoin's price is the result of buyers and sellers reaching agreements in real-time without interference from governments. As bitcoin continues its journey towards becoming a primary global store of value in the Information Age, it is unrealistic to assume that its progress would be linear.\n\nAs adoption of bitcoin increases, it becomes less risky and potential upside decreases, leading to a decrease in volatility.\n",

        "text": "The idea of backed money is contradictory, as the backing itself would then be considered money. Part of the value of money comes from its rarity. Bitcoin does not need to be backed by something else that is rare because it is inherently scarce.\n\nVerifiable and auditable through independent means, bitcoin is free of counterparty risk. There is no third party that must be trusted to keep and secure commodities or assets. If anything, it is possible that the future will be backed by bitcoin.\n\nAs Parker Lewis stated, \"Ultimately, bitcoin is backed by something, and it's the only thing that backs any money: the credibility of its monetary properties.\"\n",

        "question": "Is it possible that bitcoin becomes obsolete one day",
        "text": "Bitcoin represents a unique discovery of absolute scarcity, similar to the discovery of fire, electricity, or the field of mathematics.\n\nIt is not logical or possible to compete with bitcoin in terms of scarcity, as there is no level of scarcity higher than absolute scarcity. Criticisms of bitcoin's perceived limitations or drawbacks assume that there are no trade-offs in terms of security and incentive design, or that bitcoin's current form does not already provide significant benefits to millions of users.\n\nAs a rapidly growing, unrestricted network with a 99.98% uptime over more than a decade, having processed trillions of dollars in value and secured by billions of dollars in hardware, it is unlikely that bitcoin will be displaced as the dominant digital monetary network at this point.\n\nAs Michael Saylor stated, \"There's never been an example of a $100B monster digital network that was vanquished once it got to that dominant position.\"\n",

        "question": "How does bitcoin impact global energy consumption",
        "text": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is accessible to users around the world and is resistant to censorship due to its Proof of Work mechanism.\n\nWith an estimated four billion people currently living under authoritarianism, bitcoin provides a way for individuals to send, receive, save, and transport wealth. It is important to consider the amount of energy that a monetary network like this should consume and to carefully evaluate who is best equipped to make decisions about this.\n\nOne way to think about the impact of bitcoin on global energy consumption is to imagine a topographic map of the world, with local electricity costs represented by the peaks and troughs. Adding bitcoin to the mix is like pouring a glass of water over the map - it settles in the troughs, smoothing them out. This is because bitcoin is a global buyer of energy at a fixed price, which helps to even out the distribution of energy consumption around the world.\n",
