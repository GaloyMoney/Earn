# 501.2 Lesson - itstooVolatile

**Screen:** itstooVolatile

**Headline:** It's too volatile!

**Reward:** 2

**Text:** It is subjective to expect bitcoin to maintain a specific price range, as it is traded around the clock, every day of the year, across the world. There are no requirements for registration, bank holidays, circuit breakers, or bailouts in the bitcoin market, which operates as a truly free market.

Any and all volatility in bitcoin's price is the result of buyers and sellers reaching agreements in real-time without interference from governments. As bitcoin continues its journey towards becoming a primary global store of value in the Information Age, it is unrealistic to assume that its progress would be linear.

As adoption of bitcoin increases, it becomes less risky and potential upside decreases, leading to a decrease in volatility.
