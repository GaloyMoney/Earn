**Reward:** 2

**Text:** Gresham&#x27;s Law is a concept that explains how people tend to use different types of currency in different ways when they are in circulation together.

If two forms of currency are given equal value by a government or other authority, but one is made of a more valuable material, people will be more likely to save the more valuable currency and spend the less valuable one.

This can happen when a government debases its currency, or makes it worth less, by decreasing the amount of valuable material it contains. The result is that people lose trust in the debased currency and prefer to hold onto the more valuable one instead.

This principle can also apply to &quot;fiat&quot; currency, which is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver, if the supply of the currency is increased in a way that makes it worth less.

In recent years, the emergence of bitcoin as a digital currency has led to a trend of people saving in bitcoin and spending their traditional currency, or &quot;fiat,&quot; more quickly. This is because bitcoin is seen as having a higher long-term value and being more stable than fiat currencies.
