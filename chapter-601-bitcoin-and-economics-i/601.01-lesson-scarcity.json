          "Remark:** Correct! Good job, you understood the concept of scarcity. Scarcity can lead to competition and can affect the value of goods and services in a free market",
          "Wrong! Sorry to burst your bubble, but if something is easy to come by, it can't be scarce",
          "Wrong! Time travel is a great idea for a sci-fi movie, but it doesn't have anything to do with scarce resources."

        "question": "What is a scarce resource",
        "text": "When there are not enough resources to go around, people and organizations compete for them.\n\nThis competition is often reflected in the price of goods and services in a free market. If the demand for a particular resource increases faster than the supply, it can become scarce and more valuable.\n\nMoney is often used as a way to buy things because it is easy to trade and is valuable because it is scarce. Bitcoin is a digital form of money that has a fixed supply, which makes it rare and valuable.\n\nThe idea that there is never enough of something to go around is a basic principle of economics, but it is often ignored in political decisions.\n",
