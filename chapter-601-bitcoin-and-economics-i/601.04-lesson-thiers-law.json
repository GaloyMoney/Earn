    "Correct! Good job, you understood Thier's Law. This law discusses what might happen if people and businesses refuse to accept a lower quality form of currency. Interesting fact: Thier's Law suggests that if a government tries to force people to use a lower quality currency by making it legal tender, it will be ignored",
