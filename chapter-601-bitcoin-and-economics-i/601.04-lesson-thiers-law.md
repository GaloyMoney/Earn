**Headline:** Thier's Law

**Reward:** 3

**Text:** Thier's Law is a concept that discusses what might happen if people and businesses refused to accept or use a lower quality form of currency.

Instead of disappearing from circulation, the higher quality form of money might be traded at a premium, or for a higher value than its face value.

Thier's Law suggests that if a government tries to force people to use a lower quality currency by making it legal tender, it will be ignored.

In other words, people and businesses may choose not to accept the lower quality currency and instead prefer to use the higher quality one or other forms of payment.
