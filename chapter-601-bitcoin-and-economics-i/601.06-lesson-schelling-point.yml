  A Schelling point is a solution that people tend to choose by default, without communicating with each other.
  
  This can happen in multiplayer cooperative games, where you have to anticipate the choices of others. If you make the wrong choice, you might face consequences or miss out on benefits.
  
  Communication works the same way - it's like a multiplayer cooperative game played with others in the same network. We use standardized protocols (like email, spoken language, or money) to communicate efficiently with as many people as possible, with as little friction as possible. This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.
  
  In the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.
  
  The option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.
  
  Bitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called "fiat"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.
