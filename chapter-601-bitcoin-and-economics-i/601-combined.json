          "text": "When there are not enough resources to go around, people and organizations compete for them.\n\nThis competition is often reflected in the price of goods and services in a free market. If the demand for a particular resource increases faster than the supply, it can become scarce and more valuable.\n\nMoney is often used as a way to buy things because it is easy to trade and is valuable because it is scarce. Bitcoin is a digital form of money that has a fixed supply, which makes it rare and valuable.\n\nThe idea that there is never enough of something to go around is a basic principle of economics, but it is often ignored in political decisions.\n",

When the usual form of money is not working well, people may turn to other things that are rare or hard to obtain as a way to exchange value.\n\nSome historical forms of money had no other use or value besides being used as a way to trade for other things.

          "text": "Gresham's Law is a concept that explains how people tend to use different types of currency in different ways when they are in circulation together.\n\nIf two forms of currency are given equal value by a government or other authority, but one is made of a more valuable material, people will be more likely to save the more valuable currency and spend the less valuable one.\n\nThis can happen when a government debases its currency, or makes it worth less, by decreasing the amount of valuable material it contains. The result is that people lose trust in the debased currency and prefer to hold onto the more valuable one instead.\n\nThis principle can also apply to \"fiat\" currency, which is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver, if the supply of the currency is increased in a way that makes it worth less.\n\nIn recent years, the emergence of bitcoin as a digital currency has led to a trend of people saving in bitcoin and spending their traditional currency, or \"fiat,\" more quickly. This is because bitcoin is seen as having a higher long-term value and being more stable than fiat currencies.\n",

If you make the wrong choice, you might face consequences or miss out on benefits.\n\nCommunication works the same way - it's like a multiplayer cooperative game played with others in the same network. We use standardized protocols (like email, spoken language, or money) to communicate efficiently with as many people as possible, with as little friction as possible. This can lead to increased trade, knowledge exchange, and innovation.\n\nIn the digital world, people tend to choose the same option (the Schelling point) when exchanging value. This is because they expect that others will also choose it.\n\nThe option that becomes the Schelling point is the one that communicates price signals most accurately, allowing market participants to coordinate with each other.\n\nBitcoin is a protocol for exchanging value that has several advantages over traditional currencies (called \"fiat\"). For example, it has a fixed supply and its value has generally increased over time, while fiat currencies often lose value. Additionally, the bitcoin network is permissionless, global, and indestructible. All of these factors make bitcoin a natural Schelling point for money.\n",
