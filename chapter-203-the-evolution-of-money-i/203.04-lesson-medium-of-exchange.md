**Reward:** 3

**Text:** When money is used to store value, its value becomes stable eventually. And when the value of money is stable, it becomes the best option to facilitate trade as it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have the coordination burden of barter.

In the early days of Bitcoin in 2010, some people did not recognize the opportunity cost to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange rather than a nascent store of value.

There is a famous story about Laszlo Hanyecz who traded 10,000 bitcoins (which were worth about $165 million at the time of this writing) for just two pizzas. When Laszlo acquired those pizzas, it marked the first time that bitcoin had market value.

Today, Laszlo&#x27;s pizza is celebrated globally on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day as an important step and milestone in the evolution of bitcoin as money.
