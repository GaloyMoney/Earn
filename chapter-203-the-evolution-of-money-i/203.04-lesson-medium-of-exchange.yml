  When money is used to store value, its value becomes stable eventually. And when the value of money is stable, it becomes the best option to facilitate trade as it's easy to use and doesn't have the coordination burden of barter.
  
  In the early days of Bitcoin in 2010, some people did not recognize the opportunity cost to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange rather than a nascent store of value.
  
  There is a famous story about Laszlo Hanyecz who traded 10,000 bitcoins (which were worth about $165 million at the time of this writing) for just two pizzas. When Laszlo acquired those pizzas, it marked the first time that bitcoin had market value.
  
  Today, Laszlo's pizza is celebrated globally on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day as an important step and milestone in the evolution of bitcoin as money.
