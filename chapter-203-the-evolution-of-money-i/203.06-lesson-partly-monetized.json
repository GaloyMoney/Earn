      "Congratulations! You've chosen the correct answer. A partly monetized good is one that is not yet widely accepted as a unit of account, which means it is not commonly used as a standard way to measure the value of other goods. This can include goods like gold, which is often used to store value but not typically used for everyday transactions",
      "That's a creative answer, but unfortunately not quite right. Better luck next time",
      "Not quite correct, but close! Keep thinking."

    "question": "What is the meaning of the term \"partly monetized\"",
    "text": "Goods that are not widely accepted as a unit of account may be considered \"partly monetized\" because they are used for some purposes related to money, but not all.\n\nGold is an example of a partly monetized good that is used to store value but is not widely used as a medium of exchange or unit of account. In some countries, different goods may be used for different purposes related to money, such as one good being used as a medium of exchange and another being used as a store of value or unit of account.\n\nThe dollar is an example of a good that is widely used for all three purposes of money in the United States, while the peso was an example of a good that was used as a medium of exchange in Argentina but was not a good store of value because of its volatility and regular loss of purchasing power.\n",
