  When money is commonly used for trading, goods are priced in terms of it. This means that most goods can be exchanged for money at a certain rate.
  
  It is not accurate to say that many goods can be bought with bitcoin today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoin, the price listed is not the true value of bitcoin. Instead, it is the dollar price that the merchant wants, converted into bitcoin based on the current exchange rate between dollars and bitcoin.
  
  If the value of bitcoin goes down in terms of dollars, the merchant will ask for more bitcoin to equal the same dollar amount.
  
  Bitcoin can only be considered a unit of account (a standard way to measure the value of goods) when merchants are willing to accept it for payment without considering the exchange rate with other currencies.
