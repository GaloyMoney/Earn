      "text": "In modern times, many people in the field of monetary economics focus on the idea that money is mainly used as a way to exchange goods and services.\n\nIn the past century, however, governments have had the exclusive power to create money and have often made it difficult for money to hold its value. This lead people to believe that the main purpose of money is to be used for exchange.\n\nSome have argued that Bitcoin is not a good form of money because its value tends to change too much to be used effectively in transactions.\n\nHowever, this way of thinking is backwards. Throughout history, the use of money has developed in stages, with its value as a store of value coming before its use as a medium of exchange.\n",

When Laszlo acquired those pizzas, it marked the first time that bitcoin had market value.\n\nToday, Laszlo's pizza is celebrated globally on May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day as an important step and milestone in the evolution of bitcoin as money.\n",

Instead, it is the dollar price that the merchant wants, converted into bitcoin based on the current exchange rate between dollars and bitcoin.\n\nIf the value of bitcoin goes down in terms of dollars, the merchant will ask for more bitcoin to equal the same dollar amount.\n\nBitcoin can only be considered a unit of account (a standard way to measure the value of goods) when merchants are willing to accept it for payment without considering the exchange rate with other currencies.\n",
