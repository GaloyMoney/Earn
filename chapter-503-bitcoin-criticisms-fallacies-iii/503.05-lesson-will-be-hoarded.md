**Headline:** The Misconception of Bitcoin Hoarding

**Reward:** 4

**Text:** There is a common belief that the fixed supply of bitcoin incentivizes hoarding, or the act of holding onto bitcoin rather than spending it in the economy.

However, this logic has a few flaws. First, saving, or the act of setting aside income for future use, is often conflated with hoarding. In fact, saving is a necessary precursor to significant investment and can be seen as a responsible financial practice.

Second, holding onto bitcoin, or any form of money, is a common way to hedge against future uncertainty and does not necessarily mean that it is not being used.

As Pierre Rochard pointed out, &quot;all bitcoin are always held by someone, payments only change who is holding it.&quot; In other words, the act of holding bitcoin is itself a use of bitcoin.
