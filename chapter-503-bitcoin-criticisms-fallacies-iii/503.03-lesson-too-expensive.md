# 503.3 Lesson - tooExpensive

**Screen:** tooExpensive

**Headline:** Bitcoin is too expensive

**Reward:** 2

**Text:** One common misconception about bitcoin is that it is too expensive to purchase.

However, this belief is based on unit bias, as it is more accurate to compare the entire market capitalization of bitcoin to other assets rather than just the unit price of a single bitcoin.

It&#x27;s also worth noting that a single bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis. As the saying goes, &quot;you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin!&quot;
