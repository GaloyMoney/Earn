  Micropayments refer to very small financial transactions, often for amounts less than a dollar. These types of payments can be difficult to make using traditional financial systems, as they often have minimum amounts that can be transferred and fixed fees that can make small payments impractical.
  
  The Lightning Network allows for the possibility of making micropayments using Bitcoin. It enables users to send very small amounts of Bitcoin, down to 1 sat, without the risk of losing control of their funds to a third party (called "custodial risk").&#x20;
  
  In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain currently has minimum transaction amounts and fees that make micropayments impractical. The Lightning Network allows for minimal payments denominated in Bitcoin, using actual Bitcoin transactions. This opens up the possibility of creating new markets and making small payments more practical.
