# 401.8 Lesson - routing

**Text:** You may be thinking that setting up a payment channel with hundreds of businesses could be tedious, but no. The beauty of the Lightning Network is that it is a network of channels stitched together.

Let us say Bob convinced his friend Carol to also join the Lightning Network. Alice has a channel with Bob, and Bob has a channel with Carol. Alice and Carol can then pay each other by “routing” through Bob.

Some pretty clever cryptographic tricks guarantee that Bob cannot steal the money while it’s passing through him.

When you make a payment on the Lightning Network, your node searches for a path of channels between you and your destination. This is what’s referred to as routing. This is of course all done automatically by the involved Lightning nodes, enabling it to happen in the blink of an eye.

**Correct:** true

**Answer:** By using teleportation to instantly transfer bitcoin from one user to another

**Feedback:** Hah no, this isn't science-fiction from Star Trek, but real world cryptographic engineering! Try again

**Correct:** false

**Answer:** By using a virtual reality simulation to simulate the transfer of bitcoin between users

**Feedback:** May I interest you for a simulation of a simulation? Jokes aside, this isn't it. Try again!
