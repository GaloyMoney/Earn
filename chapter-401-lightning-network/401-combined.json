          "text": "Bitcoin, the world's most widely used and valuable digital currency, allows anyone to send value without a trusted intermediary.\n\nThere are, however, some drawbacks to bitcoin's design which prioritizes security and decentralization at the cost of scalability.\n\nTransactions confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain take up to one hour before they are irreversible.\n\nMicropayments, or payments less than a few cents, are inconsistently confirmed, and fees render such transactions unviable on the network today.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's blockchain can process around 3 transactions per second. This is generally seen as an impediment for Bitcoin to become a currency that facilitates the everyday retail transactions of millions around the world.\n",

          "text": "These drawbacks lead to a debate within the Bitcoin community about the best way to scale the Bitcoin network, often dubbed the Blocksize Wars.\n\nCompanies in the Bitcoin ecosystem argued that increasing the blocksize, which is the maximum size of a block of transactions on the blockchain, would allow more transactions to be processed per second, making the network more efficient and able to handle a larger volume of transactions.\n\nBitcoin users on the other side of the debate argued that increasing the blocksize would centralize the network, as it would require more expensive and powerful computers to process the larger blocks, and could potentially lead to Bitcoin becoming prone to censorship.\n\nThe users ultimately prevailed in preserving the decentralization and censorship-resistance of the Bitcoin network and demonstrated that Bitcoin is controlled by users, not corporations. This also meant that scaling Bitcoin would require a different enigneering solution than merely increasing the blocksize.\n",

Each time a payment is made from person A to person B, bitcoin are pushed from one side of the channel to the other.

Alice and Carol can then pay each other by “routing” through Bob.\n\nSome pretty clever cryptographic tricks guarantee that Bob cannot steal the money while it’s passing through him.\n\nWhen you make a payment on the Lightning Network, your node searches for a path of channels between you and your destination. This is what’s referred to as routing. This is of course all done automatically by the involved Lightning nodes, enabling it to happen in the blink of an eye.\n",
