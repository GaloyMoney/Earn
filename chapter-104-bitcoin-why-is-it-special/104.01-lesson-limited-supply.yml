text: |
  Governments can print fiat money in unlimited quantities.
  
  
  By way of contrast, the supply of Bitcoin is fixed — and can never exceed 21 million coins.
  
  
  A continually increasing supply of fiat money creates inflation. This means that the money you hold today is less valuable in the future.
  
  One simple example:
  A loaf of bread that cost about 8 cents in 1920. In the year 1990 one loaf cost about $1.00, and today the price is closer to $2.50 !
  
  
  The limited supply of bitcoin has the opposite effect, one of deflation.
  
  
  This means that the bitcoin you hold today is designed to be more valuable in the future — because it is scarce.
