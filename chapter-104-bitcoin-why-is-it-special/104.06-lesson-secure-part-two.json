    "question": "Has Bitcoin ever been hacked?",
    "text": "To be direct: the bitcoin network itself has never been hacked. Never once.\n\n\n  Then what exactly has been hacked?\n\n\n  Certain digital wallets that did not have proper security in place.\n\n\n  Just like a physical wallet holds fiat currency (in the form of paper bills), digital wallets hold some amount of bitcoin.\n\n\n  In the physical world, criminals rob banks — and walk away with US Dollars. The fact that someone robbed a bank does not have any relationship as to whether the US Dollar is stable or reliable money.\n\n\n  Similarly, some computer hackers have stolen bitcoin from insecure digital wallets — the online equivalent of a bank robbery.\n\n\n  However, it is important to know that the bitcoin network has never been hacked or compromised !\n",
