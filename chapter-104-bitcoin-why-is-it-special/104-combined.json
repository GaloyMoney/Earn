        "question": "Is the supply of bitcoin limited forever?",
        "text": "Governments can print fiat money in unlimited quantities.\n\n\nBy way of contrast, the supply of Bitcoin is fixed — and can never exceed 21 million coins.\n\n\nA continually increasing supply of fiat money creates inflation. This means that the money you hold today is less valuable in the future.\n\nOne simple example:\nA loaf of bread that cost about 8 cents in 1920. In the year 1990 one loaf cost about $1.00, and today the price is closer to $2.50 !\n\n\nThe limited supply of bitcoin has the opposite effect, one of deflation.\n\n\nThis means that the bitcoin you hold today is designed to be more valuable in the future — because it is scarce.\n",

The fact that someone robbed a bank does not have any relationship as to whether the US Dollar is stable or reliable money.\n\n\n  Similarly, some computer hackers have stolen bitcoin from insecure digital wallets — the online equivalent of a bank robbery.\n\n\n  However, it is important to know that the bitcoin network has never been hacked or compromised !\n",
