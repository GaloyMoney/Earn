# 104.1 Lesson - LimitedSupply

**Screen:** LimitedSupply

**Headline:** Special Characteristic

**Reward:** 2

**Text:** Governments can print fiat money in unlimited quantities.


By way of contrast, the supply of Bitcoin is fixed — and can never exceed 21 million coins.


A continually increasing supply of fiat money creates inflation. This means that the money you hold today is less valuable in the future.

One simple example:
A loaf of bread that cost about 8 cents in 1920. In the year 1990 one loaf cost about $1.00, and today the price is closer to $2.50 !


The limited supply of bitcoin has the opposite effect, one of deflation.


This means that the bitcoin you hold today is designed to be more valuable in the future — because it is scarce.
