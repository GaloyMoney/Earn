      "Yes. You can divide a bitcoin into 100,000,000 pieces. As you already know, the smallest unit of bitcoin — B0.00000001 — is known as a “sat”.",
      "Wrong. Bitcoin is highly divisible. You can easily use a very small fraction of a bitcoin.",
      "Incorrect. Although the smallest unit of US currency is one penny, a bitcoin is divisible by much more than 100x."

    "question": "What is the smallest amount of Bitcoin one can own, or use?",
    "text": "Old-fashioned fiat money can only be spent in amounts as small as one penny — or two decimal places for one US Dollar ($0.01).\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin can be divided 100,000,000 times over. This means that you could spend as little as ₿0.00000001. You will note the \"\"₿\"\" symbol, which is the Bitcoin equivalent of \"\"$\"\". Sometimes you will also see the use of BTC, instead of ₿.\n\nBy way of contrast, Bitcoin can handle very small payments — even those less than one US penny!\n",
