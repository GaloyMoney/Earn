    "question": "Is bitcoin centralized?",
    "text": "Fiat money is controlled by banks and governments — which is why people refer to it as a “centralized” currency.\n\nBitcoin is not controlled by any person, government or company — which makes it “decentralized”\n\nNot having banks involved means that nobody can deny you access to bitcoin — because of race, gender, income, credit history, geographical location — or any other factor.\n\nAnybody — anywhere in the world — can access and use Bitcoin anytime you want. All you need is a computer or smartphone, and an internet connection. In fact, even a feature phone with no internet can utilize Bitcoin with services like Machankura!\n",
