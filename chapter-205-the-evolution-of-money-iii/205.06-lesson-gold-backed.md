**Text:** In the past, some governments linked the value of their currency to a specific amount of gold, a system known as a &quot;gold standard.&quot; This meant that the government had to hold a certain amount of gold in reserve in order to issue a certain amount of currency.

This system limited the government&#x27;s ability to borrow money because they could not simply print more currency to cover the cost of borrowing. Governments often borrowed money to finance wars or other expensive projects, but the gold standard made it difficult for them to do so without first accumulating enough gold to back the new currency they wanted to issue.

The gold standard was also problematic for citizens because it did not provide any guarantee that their deposits in the bank would be safe, as the value of their money was dependent on the government&#x27;s ability to maintain its gold reserves.
