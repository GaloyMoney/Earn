    "question": "What is a potential outcome of banks issuing more paper notes than they held deposits",
    "text": "Banks sometimes issued more paper notes than they had deposits, which could cause problems in the economy. If people started to doubt the solvency of a bank, they might rush to withdraw their money all at once before others do. This is called a bank run.\n\nThe sudden loss of deposits from the bank run could reveal that the bank was using too much leverage through Fractional Reserve Banking. This could cause a lack of liquidity and bring the whole financial system to a stop.\n",
