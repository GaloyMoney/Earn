  A global reserve currency is a type of money that is widely used in international trade and financial transactions. It is the preferred or most in-demand currency for settling transactions, as it is generally stable and widely accepted.
  
  Changes to the global reserve currency can have significant geopolitical implications, as it can affect the balance of power between countries.
  
  The dominant global reserve currency has typically had a lifespan of several decades, with the US dollar serving as the dominant global reserve currency for much of the 20th century.
