  Gold can be made into coins or bars of a specific weight and purity. When trade routes expanded, it became riskier to transport large amounts of gold.
  
  As a solution, paper notes from trusted banks that could be exchanged for gold were used. In 900 CE, Chinese merchants initiated the use of paper currency to avoid having to carry thousands of coins over long distances. They started trading paper receipts from custodians where they had deposited money or goods.
  
  In the beginning these paper notes were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whomever had it in their possession (bearer instrument). These notes can be seen as a predecessor to today's banknotes.
