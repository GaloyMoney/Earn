**Reward:** 3

**Text:** To counter the problem of bank runs, governments created their own banks called &quot;central banks.&quot;

These central banks have the special power to create money. They act as a backup plan for when commercial banks run out of reserves and need extra money to stay open.

Because of this function, central banks are also called the &quot;lenders of last resort,&quot; meaning they can create and give out money when commercial banks need liquidity to service withdrawals.
