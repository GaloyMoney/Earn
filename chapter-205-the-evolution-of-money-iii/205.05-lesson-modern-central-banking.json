    "text": "To counter the problem of bank runs, governments created their own banks called \"central banks.\"\n\nThese central banks have the special power to create money. They act as a backup plan for when commercial banks run out of reserves and need extra money to stay open.\n\nBecause of this function, central banks are also called the \"lenders of last resort,\" meaning they can create and give out money when commercial banks need liquidity to service withdrawals.\n",
