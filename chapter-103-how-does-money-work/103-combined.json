      "text": "Well, everybody should care!\n\n\nThe practice of government printing money -- or increasing the supply of dollars -- leads to inflation.\n\n\nInflation is an increase in the price of goods and services. In other words, the price for something in the future will be more expensive than today.\n\n\nSo what does inflation mean for citizens?\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Pound Sterling has lost 99.5% of its value since being introduced over 300 years ago.\n\n\nIn the United States, the dollar has lost 97% of its value since the end of WWI, about 100 years ago.\n\n\nThis means a steak that cost $0.30 in 1920... was $3 in 1990… and about $15 today, in the year 2020!\n",

Often, governments will outright restrict the movement -- and sometimes even confiscate money -- without a valid reason or explanation. And even when you can send money, high transaction fees make it very expensive.\n\n\nSecond, even in the US, there has been a complete loss of privacy, as the majority of commerce takes places with debit and credit cards, as well as online with other systems such as PayPal and Apple Pay.\n\n\nEver notice how an ad appears in your social media or Gmail just moments after searching for a certain product or service? This is known as “surveillance capitalism”, and is based on companies selling your personal financial data.\n",
