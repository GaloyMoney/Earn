**Headline:** I trust my government. Why should I care about fiat money?

**Reward:** 2

**Text:** As shared in a prior quiz, the US Central Bank is the Federal Reserve, or the “Fed”.


The Fed can print more dollars at any time -- and does not need permission from the President, nor Congress, and certainly not from US citizens.


Having control of money can be very tempting for authorities to abuse -- and often time leads to massive inflation, arbitrary confiscation and corruption.


In fact, Alan Greenspan, the famous former chairman of The Fed, famously said the US “can pay any debt that it has, because we can always print more to do that”.
