        "text": "That is correct.\n\n\nIn the history of the world, there have been 775 fiat currencies created. Most no longer exist, and the average life for any fiat money is only 27 years.\n\n\nThe British Pound is the oldest fiat currency. It has lost more than 99% of its value since 1694.\n\n\nThere is no precedent for any fiat money maintaining its value over time. This is inflation.\nIt is effectively a form of theft of your own hard earned money !\n",
