    "text": "Well, everybody should care!\n\n\nThe practice of government printing money -- or increasing the supply of dollars -- leads to inflation.\n\n\nInflation is an increase in the price of goods and services. In other words, the price for something in the future will be more expensive than today.\n\n\nSo what does inflation mean for citizens?\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Pound Sterling has lost 99.5% of its value since being introduced over 300 years ago.\n\n\nIn the United States, the dollar has lost 97% of its value since the end of WWI, about 100 years ago.\n\n\nThis means a steak that cost $0.30 in 1920... was $3 in 1990â€¦ and about $15 today, in the year 2020!\n",
