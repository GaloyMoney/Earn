This is false.\n\nThe history of money goes back thousands of years to times when governments did not exist, but money did.\n\nThis proves that money is emergent and simply the most tradable good in a market. It is not a government creation and certainly does not require a government to make money work.\n",

Archeologists found that early humans used valuable tools like arrowheads, collectibles like cowry shells and commodities like barley as primitive money.\n\nThe main advantage and primary function of these primitive moneys was to improve the workings of even small barter networks. Primitive moneys achieved this by eliminating the need to match coincidences of wants, interests, supply or skill. They also greatly reduced the need for credit, which, in the absence of writing in prehistoric times, was difficult to keep track of.\n",

          "text": "The difficulty of producing new units of money compared to other forms of money is called its hardness. This can change over time as technology improves and what was once difficult to produce could become easier.\n\nIn precolonial Ghana (Africa), aggry beads (made of glass) were used as money. Glassmaking was an expensive craft in that region, which gave the aggry beads a high stock-to-flow ratio and made them rather scarce.\n\nIn the 16th century, European explorers discovered the high value ascribed to these beads by the west Africans and began importing them in mass quantities; as European glassmaking technology made them extremely cheap to produce.\n\nSlowly but surely, the Europeans used these cheaply produced beads to acquire most of the precious resources of Africa. The net effect of this incursion into Africa was the transference its vast natural resource wealth to Europeans and the conversion of aggry beads from hard money to soft money.\n\nAs societies continued to evolve, they began to move away from artifact money like stones and glass beads and towards monetary metals.\n",
