      "text": "Opportunity cost is the idea that when you choose to do one thing, you can't do something else instead. In other words, every time you make a financial decision, you have to trade off one option for another.\n\nBitcoin can help you make better financial decisions in the long term because it's a good way to store value (like saving money). This means that if you choose to invest in bitcoin, you might have to give up using that money for other things or opportunities. But if you hold onto your bitcoin, it has the potential to increase in value over time.\n\nThis is especially important right now because the traditional monetary system (called \"fiat\") is not a reliable way to save money - it's designed in a way that causes the value of money to go down over time. So, it's important to make careful financial decisions to preserve your wealth.\n",

      "text": "Time preference is the idea that the amount of time you have to wait for something to happen can affect the decisions you make.\n\nFor example, if you value the present more than the future, you might be more likely to choose something that gives you immediate gratification.\n\nOn the other hand, if you value the future more, you might be willing to wait longer for something that has a bigger benefit in the long term.\n\nThere are many factors that can influence your time preference, such as your personal safety, tax rates, property rights, and the ability to store value reliably.\n\nThe \"hardness\" of money (how well it holds its value over time) is also important because it can encourage people to save, plan, and invest for the future. It's important to note that time preference is not a fixed thing - it can change based on the incentives in your environment.\n",

      "text": "The Impossible Trinity, also known as the Mundell-Fleming Trilemma, is a concept that explains the trade-offs involved in setting international monetary policy for a sovereign nation.\n\nIt says that a country can only choose two of the following three options: fixed exchange rates, free capital flows, and independent monetary policy.\n\n  These three options cannot be pursued at the same time. This is because a country's capital flows, or the movement of money in and out of the country, can be influenced by the value of its currency and its monetary policy, which sets the rules for how much money is in circulation.\n\n  As capital becomes more mobile and can move freely across borders, it is harder for a country to control and direct its capital flows. The rise of bitcoin, a digital currency that is borderless and immune to changes in value, may further challenge a country's ability to set monetary policy.\n",

      "question": "What is the Jevons Paradox",
      "text": "The Jevons Paradox is a phenomenon that occurs when we use more of a resource, even when we are using it more efficiently. This happens because increased efficiency often leads to lower costs, which can increase demand for the resource.\n\nOne example of this is the use of coal as an energy source. In the late 1700s, people thought that coal deposits were running out, but James Watt's steam engine made it possible to use coal more efficiently. This led to an increase in the demand for coal, even though it was being used more efficiently. The relationship between energy and money is also important to consider.\n\nSome people have proposed using energy as a measure of value for money, but this has not been successful in practice. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a system called proof of work, which incentivizes people to use energy efficiently in order to earn rewards.\n\nWhile some people criticize the use of energy in this way, it is important to remember that humans are constantly finding new ways to generate energy, and we should not assume that energy is a fixed or limited resource.\n",

      "text": "Power laws are a way to understand how two things are related. When one thing changes, the other thing changes in a way that is related to the first change. Power laws can show up in different areas, like language, biology, and space. Small changes in one thing can often lead to bigger changes in the other thing.\n\nIn economics, power laws are often shown in graphs. One example of a power law is the Pareto principle, which says that about 80% of the results come from 20% of the things that cause them. In a market, this might mean that 20% of the producers make up 80% of the market.\n\nPower laws can also be seen in other parts of bitcoin, like how much power mining pools have or how many hardware wallets different companies sell. They can also be seen in how bitcoin is distributed among different addresses.\n",
