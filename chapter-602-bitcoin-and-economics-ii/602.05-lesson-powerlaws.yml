  Power laws are a way to understand how two things are related. When one thing changes, the other thing changes in a way that is related to the first change. Power laws can show up in different areas, like language, biology, and space. Small changes in one thing can often lead to bigger changes in the other thing.
  
  In economics, power laws are often shown in graphs. One example of a power law is the Pareto principle, which says that about 80% of the results come from 20% of the things that cause them. In a market, this might mean that 20% of the producers make up 80% of the market.
  
  Power laws can also be seen in other parts of bitcoin, like how much power mining pools have or how many hardware wallets different companies sell. They can also be seen in how bitcoin is distributed among different addresses.

question: What is the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, an example of
answers:
- answer: A power law in economics
  correct: true
  feedback: Good job! The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is a power law that explains how a small amount of something (like 20% of producers) can have a big impact (like 80% of the market share).
- answer: A type of pasta dish
  correct: false
  feedback: Sorry, but it looks like you need to brush up on your economics and not your culinary skills. The Pareto principle is not a type of pasta, although it might be a tasty way to remember it
- answer: A way to fold laundry
  correct: false
  feedback: I'm afraid you're going to have to put away the laundry and pay a little more attention to economics. The Pareto principle is not a way to fold clothes, but it is a useful way to understand how small changes in one thing can lead to bigger changes in another.
