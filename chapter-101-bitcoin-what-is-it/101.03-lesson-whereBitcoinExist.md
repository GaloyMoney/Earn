# Where do the bitcoins exist?

Bitcoin is a new form of money. It can be used by anyone, anytime -- anywhere in the world. It is not tied to a specific government or region (like US Dollars). There are also no paper bills, metal coins or plastic cards. Everything is 100% digital. Bitcoin is a network of computers running on the internet. Your bitcoin is easily managed with software on your smartphone or computer!
