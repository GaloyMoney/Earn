# If Bitcoin is digital money, can’t someone just copy it — and create free money?

The value of a bitcoin can never be copied. This is the very reason why Bitcoin is such a powerful new invention!! Most digital files — such as an iPhone photo, an MP3 song, or a Microsoft Word document — can easily be duplicated and shared. The Bitcoin software uniquely prevents the duplication — or “double spending” — of digital money. We will share exactly how this works later on!
