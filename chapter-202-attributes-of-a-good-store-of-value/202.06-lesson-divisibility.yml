  The ability to divide a good is an important attribute for it to be a good store of value.
  
  Imagine you have a $100 bill and want to buy a pack of chewing gum that costs 10 cents. The success of the trade depends on the seller having $99.90 in change available in that moment.
  
  In societies where trade is prevalent, the ability to divide a good into smaller quantities allows for more precise exchange and can make it easier to use in day-to-day transactions.
  
  Bitcoin is particularly useful in this regard, as it can be divided down to a hundred millionth of a unit and transmitted in tiny and exact amounts.
  
  Fiat currencies are typically divisible down to pocket change, which has little purchasing power, making fiat divisible enough in practice.
  
  Gold, while physically divisible, can be difficult to use in small quantities for everyday trade.
