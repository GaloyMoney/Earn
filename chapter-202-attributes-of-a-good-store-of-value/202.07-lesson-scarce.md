# 202.7 Lesson - scarce

**Screen:** scarce

**Headline:** A monetary good must scarce

**Reward:** 3

**Text:** A good store of value should have a limited supply, or be scarce.

This is because scarcity can create value, as people often desire rare or hard-to-obtain items. Bitcoin, for instance, is designed to have a maximum of 21 million units, which gives each owner a known percentage of the total possible supply.

In contrast, the supply of gold can potentially increase through new mining methods, and fiat currencies are often prone to inflation, leading to a decline in value over time.
