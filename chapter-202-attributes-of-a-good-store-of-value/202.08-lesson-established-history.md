# 202.8 Lesson - establishedHistory

**Screen:** establishedHistory

**Headline:** An established history of being valued by society

**Reward:** 4

**Text:** This is because a well-established store of value is less likely to be displaced by a newcomer, unless it has a significant advantage over the established good.

Additionally, people are creatures of habit and will keep using what they already know.

Gold, for example, has a long history of being valued and has maintained its value over time. In contrast, fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent invention, have a tendency to lose value over time due to inflation.

Bitcoin, although it has only been around for a short time, has shown resilience in the market and is likely to continue to be valued.
