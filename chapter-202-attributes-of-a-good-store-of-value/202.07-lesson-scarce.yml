  A good store of value should have a limited supply, or be scarce.
  
  This is because scarcity can create value, as people often desire rare or hard-to-obtain items. Bitcoin, for instance, is designed to have a maximum of 21 million units, which gives each owner a known percentage of the total possible supply.
  
  In contrast, the supply of gold can potentially increase through new mining methods, and fiat currencies are often prone to inflation, leading to a decline in value over time.
