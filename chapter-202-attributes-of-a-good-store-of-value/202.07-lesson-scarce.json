    "question": "What is the most important attribute of a store of value",
    "text": "A good store of value should have a limited supply, or be scarce.\n\nThis is because scarcity can create value, as people often desire rare or hard-to-obtain items. Bitcoin, for instance, is designed to have a maximum of 21 million units, which gives each owner a known percentage of the total possible supply.\n\nIn contrast, the supply of gold can potentially increase through new mining methods, and fiat currencies are often prone to inflation, leading to a decline in value over time.\n",
