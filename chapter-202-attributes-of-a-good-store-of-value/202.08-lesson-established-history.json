          "You are correct. A long-established store of value is less likely to be displaced by a new arrival unless the new arrival has a significant advantage over the established good",
          "Sorry, but this is actually the reason that a long-established store of value is less likely to be displaced. Better luck next time",
          "Nope, wrong. Did you not pay attention in the previous lesson on scarcity?"
        ],
        "question": "What is the main reason that a long-established store of value could be displaced by a new arrival",
        "text": "This is because a well-established store of value is less likely to be displaced by a newcomer, unless it has a significant advantage over the established good.\n\nAdditionally, people are creatures of habit and will keep using what they already know.\n\nGold, for example, has a long history of being valued and has maintained its value over time. In contrast, fiat currencies, which are a relatively recent invention, have a tendency to lose value over time due to inflation.\n\nBitcoin, although it has only been around for a short time, has shown resilience in the market and is likely to continue to be valued.\n",
