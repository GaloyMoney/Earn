  It is important for a good store of value to be easily verifiable as authentic. This increases confidence in trade and the likelihood that a transaction will be completed.
  
  Both fiat currencies and gold are generally easy to verify, but they are not foolproof. Counterfeit bills and gold-plated tungsten have been used to deceive people in the past.
  
  On the other hand, the use of cryptography makes verification very easy for bitcoin and makes counterfeiting impossible.
