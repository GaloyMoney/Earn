      "text": "There is a risk, of course, that internet access may be lost due to infrastructure failures, natural disasters, or intentional outages. However, it is possible to transact bitcoin using offline methods and other communication networks.\n\nFor instance, a signed bitcoin transaction can be transmitted to a single node and broadcast to the network for inclusion in a block by miners. There are various ways to do this, such as sending a transaction via SMS, using a physical wallet with a one-time use tamper-evident private key, or receiving blocks via satellite. These options allow for bitcoin to be used even in the event of an internet disruption.\n",

It is not accurate to claim that bitcoin's properties have led to an overall increase in criminal activity.\n\nCrime does not stem from access to tools, but rather from individual circumstances. If bitcoin is useful, it can be used by anyone, including criminals. If it is not useful, it cannot be used by anyone, including criminals.\n\nAs Parker Lewis stated, \"There is nothing inherent about the tools used to facilitate crimes that makes them criminal in themselves.

A ponzi scheme involves promises of above-market returns to investors, but as a permissionless network, bitcoin does not have a central authority that can make such promises.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin is not an investment scheme, it is a form of money. Unlike opaque investment opportunities that may be promoted to unsuspecting individuals, bitcoin's code is open-source and its supply can be independently verified at all times.\n",

      "text": "Paying with bitcoin is not the same as using a credit card to make a purchase. When you use a credit card, your payment goes through multiple parties before reaching the merchant's bank account after days or even weeks of processing.\n\nIn contrast, when you pay with bitcoin on the main blockchain, you are sending actual money directly to the recipient without any intermediaries. This means there is no risk of censorship and the transaction is considered final once it has been confirmed by six blocks on the blockchain.\n\nThe proper comparison would be between bitcoin base layer and the Fed as currency issuer and as a clearing mechanism.\n\nSince the advent of the Lightning Network, the \"Bitcoin is too slow\" criticism has largely fallen silent.\n",

This is achieved through a consensus process in which every transaction that has been confirmed on the bitcoin network is independently validated.\n\nWhile anyone can fork the code and make changes to the rules, it is unlikely that this version of the code would be adopted by the wider network. The decentralized consensus process and the incorruptible supply of bitcoin are crucial to its appeal as a form of money.\n\nThe maximum supply of bitcoin is fixed at 21 million, and any attempt to increase this limit would require consensus from a significant portion of the bitcoin network, which is highly unlikely to happen.\n",
