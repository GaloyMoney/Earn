    "Well done! You've correctly identified that it is not accurate to claim that bitcoin's properties have led to an overall increase in criminal activity.",
    "I see you're a fan of sensational headlines and jumping to conclusions. Unfortunately, that's not based in reality",
    "It looks like you're trying to take a balanced approach, but is not accurate to make this claim regardless of individual circumstances. Try again."

  "question": "Is it accurate to claim that bitcoin's properties have led to an overall increase in criminal activity",
  "text": "Bitcoin is a neutral tool for exchanging value, and it has no inherent beliefs, opinions, or values. Its meaning is determined by how it is used. It is not accurate to claim that bitcoin's properties have led to an overall increase in criminal activity.\n\nCrime does not stem from access to tools, but rather from individual circumstances. If bitcoin is useful, it can be used by anyone, including criminals. If it is not useful, it cannot be used by anyone, including criminals.\n\nAs Parker Lewis stated, \"There is nothing inherent about the tools used to facilitate crimes that makes them criminal in themselves. Despite criminal use, no one is calling for the ban of roads, the internet, mail, etc.\"\n",
