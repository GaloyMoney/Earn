    "question": "How can bitcoin transactions be sent in the event of an internet disruption",
    "text": "There is a risk, of course, that internet access may be lost due to infrastructure failures, natural disasters, or intentional outages. However, it is possible to transact bitcoin using offline methods and other communication networks.\n\nFor instance, a signed bitcoin transaction can be transmitted to a single node and broadcast to the network for inclusion in a block by miners. There are various ways to do this, such as sending a transaction via SMS, using a physical wallet with a one-time use tamper-evident private key, or receiving blocks via satellite. These options allow for bitcoin to be used even in the event of an internet disruption.\n",
