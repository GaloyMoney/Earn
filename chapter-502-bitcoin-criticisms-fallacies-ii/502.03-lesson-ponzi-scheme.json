      "Congratulations! You've earned some sats for correctly identifying that bitcoin is a form of money. Did you know that bitcoin was the first decentralized digital currency to be created, and it operates without a central bank or single administrator",
      "Ah hah! You fell for the old ponzi scheme trick! Just kidding, but seriously, that's not what bitcoin is",
      "Nope, sorry! Bitcoin isn't an open-source investment scheme. But hey, at least you're learning about it, right?"

    "question": "Which of the following statements is true about bitcoin",
    "text": "Calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme shows a lack of understanding of both bitcoin and the definition of a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme involves promises of above-market returns to investors, but as a permissionless network, bitcoin does not have a central authority that can make such promises.\n\nAdditionally, bitcoin is not an investment scheme, it is a form of money. Unlike opaque investment opportunities that may be promoted to unsuspecting individuals, bitcoin's code is open-source and its supply can be independently verified at all times.\n",
