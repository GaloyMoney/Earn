  Calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme shows a lack of understanding of both bitcoin and the definition of a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme involves promises of above-market returns to investors, but as a permissionless network, bitcoin does not have a central authority that can make such promises.
  
  Additionally, bitcoin is not an investment scheme, it is a form of money. Unlike opaque investment opportunities that may be promoted to unsuspecting individuals, bitcoin's code is open-source and its supply can be independently verified at all times.
