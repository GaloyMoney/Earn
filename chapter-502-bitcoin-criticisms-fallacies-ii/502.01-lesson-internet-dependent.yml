  There is a risk, of course, that internet access may be lost due to infrastructure failures, natural disasters, or intentional outages. However, it is possible to transact bitcoin using offline methods and other communication networks.
  
  For instance, a signed bitcoin transaction can be transmitted to a single node and broadcast to the network for inclusion in a block by miners. There are various ways to do this, such as sending a transaction via SMS, using a physical wallet with a one-time use tamper-evident private key, or receiving blocks via satellite. These options allow for bitcoin to be used even in the event of an internet disruption.
